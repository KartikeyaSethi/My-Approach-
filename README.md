# My-Approach-
This repo talks about how programming can be approached

Languages to focus on :
1. Assembly - I know it's hard, but it's worth it. 
2. C/C++ - Beautiful way of expressing the above
3. Python - wrapper with some really helpful libraries and awesome functionalities

Why Assembly?
  Allows you to reverse engineer stuff.
  Let's you see the working of your favourite video game, lets you understand malware and many other wonderful things

Why C/C++?
  Want more control over your porgramme
  Let's you do some amazing things such as write your own programming language
  Low latency applications - yes please, working on self driving cars/robots - this should be your default choice

Why Python?
  When things get difficult to understand in the above mentioned and you want to build something.
  Let's you utilise different libraries which can make ML/DL tasks much simpler to code
  Data Visualisation - no problem

Additionaly, I would recommend that a person learn at least one functional language such as Haskell

Unpopular Opinion : SQL is your friend.
